# Visual Genome Semantic Search

Steps to install:
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Run `python setup.py` to download a pre-processed minimal visual genome graph and set up a TinkerPop server.

3. Run `python start_demo.py` to start the demo.
<!-- 2. Run `python vg2graphml.py` to generate a GraphML file with reduced set of objects and relations from the visual genome.

3. Download the apache tinkerpop server and place `gremlin-server.sh` in `bin`, `load-vg-scene-graph.groovy` in `scripts` directory, and `gremlin-server-vg-scene-graph.yaml` in `conf`. In a separate terminal run `./bin/gremlin-server.sh conf/gremlin-server-vg-scene-graph.yaml` to get the server up and running.

4. Start the web server by running `FLASK_APP=frontend.py flask run` from a separate command line and navigate with your browser to the given local address.

5. Search away!!! -->
